# Form Submission with API Interaction

## Overview
This project implements a simple iOS screen featuring a form that allows users to input data, which is then submitted to a specified API. The application handles the API response and displays the resulting data on the screen, demonstrating best practices in UI/UX, error handling, and clean architecture.

## Features
- **User Input**: The form consists of input fields for user data (e.g., name, email).
- **API Submission**: Submits user input to a designated API endpoint upon form submission.
- **Response Display**: Successfully received data from the API is displayed on the screen.
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages are shown for various scenarios, including:
  - Validation errors (e.g., required fields not filled).
  - Network errors (e.g., no internet connection).
  - Server errors (e.g., invalid response from the API).

## UI/UX Design
- The form is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing, with clear labels and placeholder text.
- A loading indicator is shown during the API request to inform users that their submission is being processed.
- Error messages are prominently displayed to guide users in correcting their inputs.

## Architecture
The project follows clean architecture principles, structured with separate layers for:
- **Presentation**: Manages the UI and user interactions.
- **Domain**: Handles business logic and use cases.
- **Data**: Responsible for network calls and data manipulation.

This separation ensures that components are loosely coupled and can be easily tested and maintained.

## Technology
- **Swift**: The programming language used for iOS development.
- **UIKit**: For building the user interface.
- **URLSession**: For handling network requests.
- **XCTest**: For unit testing functionalities.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the application on a simulator or a physical device.

## Example API
Utilize a public API such as JSONPlaceholder or a mock server to test the form submission functionality.

## Conclusion
This implementation serves as an example of how to create a responsive and user-friendly interface for form submissions in an iOS application while adhering to clean architecture principles. For any questions or further clarifications, please reach out.
